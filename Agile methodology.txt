Agile methods have become one of the hottest trends in software development in the latest years – Extreme programming, Scrum, Lean Software Development, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, 
Crystal Clear, Feature-Driven Development, Pragmatic Programming.

Ideas:
Individuals and their interactions are more important than processes and tools.
Working software is more important than complete and consistent documentation.
Cooperation with the Customer is more important than contractual obligations.
<<Reaction to changes is more important than following the plan>>.

Agile Manifesto Principles:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and <<continuous delivery of valuable software>>. 
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. 
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is <<face-to-face conversation>>. 
Working software is the primary measure of progress. 
Agile processes promote <<sustainable development>>. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential. 
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then <<tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly>>.

===================== Scrum Notes =====================
Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage complex product development.

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. 
Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage.

The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them.

<<Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally>>, maximizing opportunities for feedback.

Product Backlog items show what the Scrum team will work on next. 

The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.
The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team.
He is responsible for managing the Product Backlog.
The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. 
Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.
